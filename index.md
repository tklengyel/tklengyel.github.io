I'm currently a Security Researcher at <a href="https://www.sec.in.tum.de">TU Munich</a>, focusing on virtualization security of mobile and embedded devices. I'm also a PhD candidate at the <a href="http://cse.uconn.edu">University of Connecticut</a> where I'm in the process of finishing my dissertation on malware collection and analysis via hardware virtualization. I'm also an open-source developer, contributing to projects such as <a href="http://libvmi.com">LibVMI</a> and the <a href="http://xenproject.org">Xen hypervisor</a>. I'm also working with <a href="http://zentific.com">Zentific LLC</a>, with whom I have participated in a <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/opencatalog/CFT.html">DARPA Cyber Fast Track</a> project.

My research interest include a broad range of topics related to computer security, including intrusion detection, operating system design, virtualization, live and forensics memory analysis, rootkits, as well as static and dynamic malware analysis. My area of expertise is around a technology called Virtual Machine Introspection.
